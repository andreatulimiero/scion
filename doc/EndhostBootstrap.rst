Automated end host bootstrapping
********************************

This file documents the design of the end host bootstrapping.

Overview
========

Low entry barriers are crucial to push people to experiment with new
technologies.
The goal of automated end host bootstrapping is to let anyone joining the
SCION internet effortlessly.
From within an AS, all an end user needs to do is installing a package.

In particular, the package contains a bootstrapper daemon that retrieves
hints from the local network using `zero conf` services, downloads the
required SCION configuration files from a local discovery server, and starts
the SCION Daemon (SD).

Design
======

Bootstrapping Process
---------------------

An external orchestrator (e.g., *systemd*) will manage the bootstrapper
daemon and start the SD once the bootstrapper finishes successfully.

Bootstrapping Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A **hint** is a piece of information returned by a `zero conf` service deployed
in the local network.
Depending on the discovery mechanism, a hint can be either sufficient to contact
a discovery server (e.g., providing its IP address) or can be used to query the local
network further (e.g., a DNS PTR response).

A **discovery server** is a web server that exposes the endpoints required
by the bootstrapper (more in the *Discovery Server* section).

A **discoverer** is a client of a `zero conf` service. It, communicates with the service
and provides hints to the bootstrapper.

Bootstrapping Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The bootstrapping process consists of the following:

1. The bootstrapper daemon probes the local network for hints about a
   discovery server address using the available discovery mechanisms (i.e., DHCP, DNS, and mDNS).
2. Wait for hints from discoverers.
3. Once a hint gets received, the bootstrapper tries to download the topology of
   the AS and some TRCs from the discovery server. While there is no minimum amount of TRCs to
   be served, the discovery server must provide at least the TRC of the ISD the AS is in.

   a. On success, the bootstrapper prepares the SD's files and exits successfully, and the SD is automatically started by the orchestrator.
   b. On failure, go back to 2.


If no hint is received after a certain period, the bootstrapper times out
and exits with a non-zero value.

NB: The TRCs retrieval is a temporary solution; in the future, they will be
installed on a device via other means, ideally before it gets connected to
a network at all (more in the *Security* section).

Discovery Mechanisms
--------------------

In this section, we analyze the various discovery mechanisms supported
by the bootstrapper.
For clarity's sake, we suppose the following setting:

- the end host is located in the ``ethz.ch`` domain, and
- the IP address of the discovery server serving the bootstrapping files can
  be reached at ``192.168.1.1``.

DHCP
^^^^

The DHCP mechanism requires a DHCP server present in the network.
Therefore, deploying the DHCP discovery mechanism is only worth the effort if a DHCP server
is already running on the network.
The DHCP server has to be configured to announce the addresses of the discovery services
in the option field with ID 72 ”Default WWW server”, for example, whose content is ``192.168.1.1``.
We chose this existing option to ease rapid development without going through a formal standardization
at IETF and because we use the same application-level protocol as used in the WWW, namely HTTP.

This mechanism is the obvious choice for small networks, covering scenarios such as household networks.

DNS
^^^

The DNS-based mechanisms require public DNS to be set up to contain the necessary records.

Some minimal setups are listed below:

*DNS SRV*

As specified in [RFC2782]_, a DNS SRV record redirects to an ``A`` record pointing to the discovery server:

- ``_sciondiscovery._tcp.ethz.ch IN SRV 8041 sciondiscovery.ethz.ch``
- ``sciondiscovery.ethz.ch IN A 192.168.1.1``

*DNS-SD*

As specified in [RFC6763]_, a list of DNS PTR records points to SRV records,
each of which defines an instance of a SCION discovery service:

- ``_sciondiscovery._tcp.ethz.ch IN PTR SCI-ED._sciondiscovery._tcp.ethz.ch``
- ``SCI-ED._sciondiscovery._tcp.ethz.ch IN SRV 8041 scied-sciondiscovery.ethz.ch``
- ``scied-sciondiscovery.ethz.ch IN A 192.168.1.1``

*DNS-NAPTR*

In this variant, a DNS NAPTR record redirects to an ``A`` record pointing to the
discovery server:

- ``ethz.ch IN NAPTR "A" "x-sciondiscovery:tcp" "" sciondiscovery.ethz.ch``
- ``sciondiscovery.ethz.ch IN A 192.168.1.1``

Like the DNS-SD option, multiple NAPTR records for different discovery services
can be defined.

This mechanism is well suited for large-scale networks having control over their DNS domain.
Supporting both of them gives network operators more flexibility to choose depending on their DNS layout.

mDNS
^^^^

mDNS, a decentralized DNS based on IP multicasting, is usually used
in combination with DNS-SD to realize *zero conf* networks.
It removes the need for a centralized DNS server, but it might not be 
easy to correctly set up a network to work with multicast traffic.
It is a lightweight solution that requires just one entity besides the client in the network.
On the one hand, mDNS is a very lightweight and simple solution to deploy.
However, when planning to deploy mDNS, one must keep in mind that it relies on IP multicast communication.
If all participating hosts reside this should raise no issue; however, if the network is divided by a router,
between the clients and the discovery server, the router has to be configured to propagate multicast traffic
between the two subnets for the discovery to work.

This mechanism is quite flexible and can be used in almost every scenario.
However, since devices need to be in the same subnet to discover each other it just does not work with a large,
segmented enterprise network.

Discovery Server
----------------

The discovery server (e.g. *Nginx*) exposes the following endpoints to
serve the bootstrapping configuration files:

- ``/scion/discovery/<version>/topology.json``: to retrieve the topology of
  the AS, and
- ``/scion/discovery/<version>/trcs.tar``: to retrieve the TRCs needed by the SD.

NB: The endpoints are kept separate since in the future the latter will be removed.
As previously pointed out, the TRCs will be installed on a device via different
means.


Security
========

Guaranteeing the genuinity of the retrieved resources is crucial to ensure that
a user's connection is safe. To certify a resource this can be signed
so that after the download the bootstrapper can verify its authenticity.

In the current internet, the root of trust is based on an oligopoly of CAs.
In SCION, this root of trust is represented by ISD-wise TRCs.
Nonetheless, like the current internet, a device joining a network for the first time
needs to have some pre-shared knowledge to judge what it's authentic or not.

While we can consider the TRCs as a temporary solution, the same is not true for the
topology -- which is at the heart of the automatic bootstrapping.
For this, a signing solution based on the asymmetric key of an AS can be implemented.

Request for Comments
====================

1. Unlike the DHCP option, the DNS SRV record can specify a port to reach the
   service. Currently, if the port is not the canonical one, the 8041,
   the hint is discarded.
   Do we want this behavior?
   In my opinion, we should change this.
2. The name server the DNS discovery mechanisms uses is now retrieved via DHCP,
   instead of looking it up locally (since most likely it has been already
   retrieved with the DHCP exchange when the device obtained an IP address).
   The motivation for this was to be OS independent.
   Do we want to keep this behavior?
